# Small City Generator
## A Random Procedural City Generator
### By Fazil Shaikh and Jon Mallozzi


We have made a procedural city generator that generates different types of city layouts. We managed to get the textures, object geometries, and colors to randomize and added two different views, first-person and Skyview, from which the city can be observed. Also, we have the movement set up for the first-person mode and different camera angles for the Skyview.

All textures are in textures folder <br/>
Build contains all of the three.js files to get project to work<br/>

All code was done in ProceduralCity.html file

Screenshots of some randomly generated cities is provided in the screenshots folder
