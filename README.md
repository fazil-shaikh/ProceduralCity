# Small City Generator
## A Random Procedural City Generator
### By Fazil Shaikh and Jon Mallozzi


We made a procedural city generator that generates different types of city layouts which can then be explored. We managed to get the textures, object geometries, and colors to randomize and added two different views, first-person and Skyview, from which the city can be observed. We have the movement set up for the first-person mode and different camera angles for the Skyview. So you can take a walk around the city if you want or you can simply spectate the skylines from above. You will notice that you can go through buildings and other objects. That is because your character is actually a ghost, and it has nothing to do with us not having enough time to implement collision-detection! Enjoy. 

We were inspired by these articles/repositories: [medium article](https://medium.com/@Rototu/making-a-procedural-skyscraper-city-generator-with-three-js-and-webgl2-8f8b721bd044),

All textures are included in the textures folder <br/>
The build contains all of the three.js files necessary to run the project<br/>

All code was done in ProceduralCity.html file
Screenshots of some randomly generated cities are provided in the screenshots folder
